# Google Colab

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) enables the remote development and execution of Python programs in the cloud, instead of on your local computer.

A colab document is essentially a Python notebook in Google Drive. Python notebooks use a mix of "code cells" and "text cells" to produce outputs helpful for instructional and presentation purposes.

Here are more essential resources for learning how to use Colab:

  + [Using Colab with GitHub](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb)

Colab is a ground-breaking new tool, but still has limitations, primarily in the areas of security and reproducibility.
