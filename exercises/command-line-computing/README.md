# "Command-line Computing" Exercise

Before we start learning about Python or software development, it will be helpful for us to achieve a basic level of familiarity with the command-line. Throughout the semester, we will be using the command-line to navigate and manage our computer's filesystem, execute Python scripts, and perform other important tasks using various command-line utilities (CLIs).

> NOTE: Commands can differ, depending on your computer's operating system. By default, most coding documentation references what is called "linux-style" commands:
>  + On Mac OS, the default Terminal application will allow students to use linux-style commands.
>  + On Windows OS, the default Command Prompt application uses different commands, but installing the Git Bash application will allow students to use linux-style commands.

## Instructions

Follow along with one of the following guides:

  + [The Linux Command-Line](mac-terminal.md) - RECOMMENDED FOR ALL STUDENTS (MAC OR WINDOWS)
  + [The Windows Command-Prompt](windows-command-prompt.md) - NOT RECOMMENDED

> TIPS:
>   + Pressubg the up arrow will cycle through recent commands
>   + Pressing tab will auto-complete filepaths
>   + Typing "clear" and pressing enter (or just pressing "command + k" on Mac) will clear the screen
