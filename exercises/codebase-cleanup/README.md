# "Codebase Cleanup" Assignment

## Learning Objectives

  + Develop new features in a controlled manner, by adopting Git branch operations and a Pull Request workflow.
  + Practice collaborating with other developers and conducting Peer Reviews.
  + Simplify an existing codebase to decrease future maintenance costs, and reduce errors.
  + Write and execute automated tests to verify code is functioning as expected.
  + Incorporate automated checks (like running tests on a Continuous Integration server), to determine whether code updates are ready to be merged / adopted.

## Examples

See the following examples of fully-tested projects:

  + [Shopping Cart Tests](https://github.com/s2t2/shopping-cart-screencast/tree/testing)
  + [Robo Advisor Tests](https://github.com/s2t2/robo-advisor-screencast/tree/v3-testing)

## Evaluation

Each of the two projects will comprise half of the weight for each of the categories below:

Category | Description | Weight
--- | --- | ---
Pull Request Workflow | At least one or two Pull Requests used during development | 20%
Simplification | Current state of the code is reasonably well organized and simplified | 20%
Documentation | Most if not all functions are documented via "docstring" comments | 20%
Automated Testing | Presence of at least a few tests which directly invoke functions from the source code to verify the program behaves as expected | 30%
Continuous Integration | Tests have been run and passed on a CI server at least once, ideally as part of the Pull Request workflow | 10%
Code Quality | The Code Climate service has been integrated into the Pull Request workflow to provide automated code quality checks | 10% (BONUS)
Peer Reviews | A peer has provided an unofficial comment or official review as part of the Pull Request workflow | 0% (OPTIONAL)

> NOTE: you'll be evaluated according to the rubric above, not any previous functionality requirements. Instructors will be reading your code and running your tests and inspecting your GitHub Pull Request history, but not necessarily running your application code directly.
